# Job Portal Website

This is a Job Portal website built using Django, Bootstrap, and SQLite database. It provides a platform for recruiters to post job openings, candidates to search and apply for jobs, and for both recruiters and candidates to manage their profiles and applications.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization (roles: employer, applicant)

- **Recruiter Registration Form:** Recruiters can register on the platform by filling out a registration form. Upon registration, they will have their own dashboard.

- **Candidate Registration Form:** Candidates can also register by providing their details. After registration, candidates can access their dashboard.

- **Job Listing Section:** Recruiters can create job postings with details such as job title, description, requirements, and application deadline. These job posts are displayed in the job posts section.

- **Profile Section:** Both recruiters and candidates have access to a profile section where they can update their information, including contact details and resume uploads.

- **Application Tracking:** Recruiters can see a list of candidates who have applied to their job postings. Candidates can view a list of job posts they have applied to.
  
- **Resume** Applicants can upload a resume and employers can view it.

- CRUD operations for job listings and applications
  
- Filtering job listings by industry, job type, location
  
- Pagination and sorting of job listings
